Riot Prediction using Data Analysis and ML

### Introduction
A riot is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people. Riots typically involve theft, vandalism, and destruction of property, public or private.

For the last 5 years, there has been a constant rise in the numbers of riots occurring in India. They are mostly about;
* Religions | Inter-religious clashes.
* Caste | Upper castes vs Dalit clashes
* Racist Clashes | North Indian vs Mongoloid Community Clashes
* Separatist Riots | Riots related to Militant Activities at border areas.
(_although there are several other types of riot as in Campus Riots,Servicemen Riots etc and __there are many instances where a riot may not be classified into a single type because of the presence of many interrelated factors__ the makes the classification confusing._

#### In this project we are only sticking to the major type of riots and predictions will be made on the basis of 5 points as follows:_
1. Sentiment Ananlysis of Public Outrages on Social Forums.
2. Astonishing rise in the numbers of Religious|Political contents with negative polarity in social media platforms.
