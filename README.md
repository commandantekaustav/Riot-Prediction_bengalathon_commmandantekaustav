Riot Prediction using Data Analysis and ML

### Riot:
>A riot is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, >property or people. Riots typically involve theft, vandalism, and destruction of property, public or private.

For the last 5 years, there has been a constant rise in the numbers of riots occurring in India. They are mostly about;
* Religions | Inter-religious clashes.
* Caste | Upper castes vs Dalit clashes
* Racist Clashes | North Indian vs Mongoloid Community Clashes
* Separatist Riots | Riots related to Militant Activities at border areas.

>(_although there are several other types of riot as in Campus Riots,Servicemen Riots etc and __there are many instances where a riot may >not be classified into a single type because of the presence of many interrelated factors__ the makes the classification procedure a lot >more confusing and inefficient too._

#### In this project we are only sticking to the major type of riots and predictions will be made on the basis of 5 points as follows:_
1. Sentiment Ananlysis and classification of Public Outrages on Social Forums.
2. Astonishing rise in the numbers of Religious | Political contents with negative polarity in social media platforms.
3. Sentiment Analysis of contents published by political or any other type of public leaders.
4. Analysis of the data and reports collected from recent riots to fetch out meaningful insights.
5. Historical Data analysis for pattern recognitions. (Maybe later)

#### Metric System:
A proper metric system is needed to be defined in a well calculated and documented manner such that it provides a better and structured way of prediction and increases understandability.
At first, metrics may be defined in a intuitive manner but it is intended to have a mathematical definition in the near future. (It's better to use both intuition and mathematics in a balanced manner).

#### Data collection:
It involves mining of public data from various Sources and and manual generation of data for some particular cases.
